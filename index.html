        <h1>Our story</h1>
        <h3>Kleem Organics is proud to be a trusted brand when it comes to clean beauty, serving over 8 Million
            customers.
            <br>
            Never sacrifice safety for effectiveness - Get unparalleled results and the security that comes with
            products that are good for you.</h3>
        <div class="grey-section-two">
            <p>Kleem Organics began as a small business in Malta with a mission to create natural and effective skin
                care products. Since the launch of our first product, Vitamin C Serum, its consumers have fueled us to
                continuously improve and re-imagine the skin care routine, inspiring us to develop products that truly
                make a difference in the skin.
                <br>
                As we grew our mission evolved. We believe that everyone deserves access to natural and safe personal
                care products and we strive to empower our consumers to recognize that they have a choice in their
                beauty and wellness routines.
                <br>
                And while we believe that nature offers the best for safe and effective skin care, we also know that
                beautiful skin begins with healthy skin. With that in mind, we set out to discover a unique blend of
                ingredients that was safe for all skin types and supports the skin’s natural barrier. The result was our
                proprietary strength in botanical complex, a specialized blend of botanical ingredients that support
                optimal skin health for real beauty results.</p>

            <p>Kleem Organics Anti-aging Face Cream has a rich, nourishing yet fast-absorbing texture that works to
                reduce
                signs of aging, skin discoloration, acne scars, to improve texture and firmness and to deeply restore
                the
                skin
                from external aggressions making it more resilient and healthier every day. Thanks to its premium
                complex of
                vitamins and antioxidants, this all-in-one anti-wrinkle cream treats fine lines and wrinkles, lack of
                firmness,
                uneven tone, age spots, uneven texture, dryness and dullness. Additional ingredients including shea
                butter
                and
                phospholipids offer hydration and nutrition for softer, smoother and more supple skin. The high
                percentage
                of
                Retinol at 2.5% in volume allows to stimulate collagen and elastin production while increasing cellular
                renewal
                without being harsh on the skin. The effective yet gentle formula protects, replenishes and enhances the
                skin’s
                natural radiance. With the introduction of this highly performing formula in your daily routine, not
                only
                will
                your skin be regenerated but also protected from the environmental aggressors we cope with in our
                everyday
                life.
                Thanks to its cutting-edge and premium ingredients and the way they are combined you will obtain a
                visibly
                firmer, plumper and clearer skin.</p>

                        If you want to be your best self, feel more beautiful and confident in your own skin, you need
                        to look for skin care products with a high percentage of bio-active ingredients that act at a
                        cellular level.
                        Our unique formula is designed to work through the night, when skin is believed to be most
                        receptive, to smooth and visibly reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
                        Kleem Organics Advanced anti-wrinkle cream is a light weight face cream which replenishes
                        moisture into your skin, making it plumped, glowing and young looking.
                        Hydration is only the beginning. Our sophisticated moisturizer goes one step further in
                        understanding skin needs.
                        Beyond replenishing water loss and locking moisture into the skin cells, Kleem Organics Advanced
                        anti-wrinkle cream boosts collagen production to help firm and smooth fine lines and wrinkle for
                        a radiantly healthy and replumped skin.
